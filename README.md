# Transferring-GANs 

1.Code base for determining Correlation coefficient between trained discriminator from GAN and Resnet classifier.

2. Idea was to tranfer trained classifier to Discriminator.

3. The idea failed because to difference in the filter learned in discriminator and Classifier.

4. The code has following algorithm applied :

    a. SVCCA(by Deepmind)
    
    b. AM-GAN
    
    c. Resnet
    
    d. Inception and FID Score
    
 
5. Point 3 is just a brief explaination. If you want proper result of correlation classification,Inception and FID scores for both GAN trained fom scratch and one trained using tranfer learning email me.
6. For better explaination of the reason of failure,contact me.
